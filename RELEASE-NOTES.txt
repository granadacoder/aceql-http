
                     AceQL HTTP
                    Release Notes



Introduction
------------

AceQL HTTP is a secure framework of REST like HTTP APIs that allow to 
access to remote SQL databases over HTTP from any device that supports HTTP. 

AceQL HTTP is provided with three client SDKs:
- The AceQL C# Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using Microsoft SQL 
  Server like calls in their code, just like they would for a local database.
- The AceQL Client JDBC Driver allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using Java and  
  JDBC calls in their code, just like they would for a local database.
- The AceQL Python Client SDK allows SQL calls to be encoded with standard 
  unmodified DB-API 2.0 syntax.

Security has been taken into account from the design: it is allowed to specify 
and code strong security rules in order to protect the databases. 

AceQL HTTP is licensed through the GNU Lesser General Public License 
(LGPL v2.1).

  

AceQL HTTP Version 8.1 - 11-Oct-2021
------------------------------------
             
Bugs fixed:
- StatementAnalyzer.isWithSemicolons() would always return false.
  This has been fixed.
- Spaces were not supported around commas in sqlFirewallManagerClassNames
  array in aceql-server.properties files. This has been fixed.      
- A SELECT containing a column named FULLTEXT induced request rejection by 
  any SqlFirewallManager implementation. Because the bug is due to an external Java 
  library code, this has been temporarily fixed by replacing FULLTEXT occurrences 
  by _FULLTEXT_ when checking the SELECT. 


AceQL HTTP Version 8.0 - 01-Sep-2021
------------------------------------

What's New:
- AceQL Server may be run in stateless mode. See conf/aceql-server.properties 
  comments the AceQL Manager Servlet Section & User Documentation.
- Core has be changed to support INSERT and UPDATE calls in batch
  mode  from C# Client SDK, Java Client JDBC Driver, and Python Client SDK.
- The garbage collectors thread for the abandoned/unclosed JDBC Connections 
  has been suppressed in order to simplify the architecture. Cleanup is now
  done using a Tomcat JdbcInterceptor class implementation. This eliminates 
  the need for a dedicated background thread.
- Tomcat base libraries have been upgraded to 9.0.52.
- Waffle library has been upgraded to 3.0.0.


AceQL HTTP Version 7.2 - 15-Jun-2021

  Corresponding JDBC calls will be implemented in the next version of the
  AceQL Client JDBC Driver. 
- The new provided DenyTclManager (SqlFirewallManager implementation) allows
  to deny TCL (Transaction Control Language) calls.


AceQL HTTP Version 7.1 - 07-May-2021
------------------------------------

What's New:

- Output speed of SELECT calls has been improved.

- The new PropertiesPassworManager interface allows to define a password
  for encrypting property values in the aceql-server.properties file.
- Tomcat embedded version has been updated from 8.5 to 9.0 (9.0.45).   
- The Windows user interface design uses now a more modern Look and Feel.
- The Windows user interface supports now the dark mode.

Bugs fixed:

What's New:

- Java start parameters values have been changed to -Xms256M -Xmx4096M for
  Linux version.
- Tomcat base libraries have been upgraded to 8.5.63.


AceQL HTTP Version 6.3 - 05-Dec-2020
------------------------------------

What's New:

- In addition to UserAuthenticator, the new RequestHeadersAuthenticator interface 
  provides an alternate or supplementary authentication mechanism.
  RequestHeadersAuthenticator implementation allows to check the HTTP request 
  headers sent by the client side, and thus to grant or forbid access to the AceQL Server.
- Tomcat base libraries have been upgraded to 8.5.60.


AceQL HTTP Version 6.2 - 17-Nov-2020
------------------------------------

What's New:

- The new session.timelifeMinutes property in aceql-server.properties  file
  allows defining the session lifetime of client users without any programming.
- In SessionConfigurator interface and dependencies: the getSessionTimelife() method
  has been renamed to getSessionTimelifeMinutes() for the sake of clarity.
  
Bugs fixed:

-  JwtSessionConfigurator.verifySessionId(String sessionId) and 
   DefaultSessionConfigurator.verifySessionId(String sessionId) would not 
   verify correctly session expirations. This has been fixed.


AceQL HTTP Version 6.1 - 24-Oct-2020
------------------------------------

What's New:

- Default Java memory configurations are now -Xms256m -Xmx4096m on both
  Windows and Linux in order to support a heavy load. 
- Most base libraries have been upgraded to the latest version.
  

AceQL HTTP Version 6.0 - 19-Sep-2020
------------------------------------

What's New:

- Java vendor and version are displayed at server startup.
- JDBC Statement.execute() calls are now supported.
- Statement.setMaxRows(int) is now supported when called
  by a Java client.
- The aceql-server.properties model file contains now documentation
  on testOnBorrow & validationQuery attributes and how to  ensure that 
  the JDBC Connection Pool will still accessible after the restart 
  of the SQL engine in use.
- Implement server side JDBC metadata calls. This will
  allow the Client Java SDK to be plugged as a real JDBC Driver.
  (The AceQL JDBC Driver is work in progress).
 - Add /get_catalog and /get_schema API.
 - Included PostgreSQL Driver has been updated to 42.2.5.
 - Tomcat base libraries have been upgraded to 8.5.58.
 
Bugs fixed:
- An SQLException could be swallowed during a transaction (autocommit off). This
  could lead to subsequent errors when trying to re-use the Connection in some
  db engines such as PostgreSQL.
  (org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: current transaction is aborted, 
  commands ignored until end of transaction block).
  This has been fixed: Connections in autocommit off are now always rollbacked 
  in case of SQLException.
- Columns were in lowercase when sent to the client. This has been fixed.
- Empty string SQL parameters ("") were refused by the AceQL Server. 
  This has been fixed.
  
  
AceQL HTTP Version 5.1 - 03-Aug-2020
------------------------------------

What's New:

- The new API WebServerAPI.isServerRunning() has been added.
- An error message is displayed if an attempt of calling more than one
  AceQL instance in the JVM is detected.
- NullPointerException throws are replaced by Objects.requireNonNull().
  This makes easier for API users to debug NullPointerExceptions.
- Tomcat base libraries have been updated to 8.5.57 because of security 
  requirements.
  
Bugs fixed:
- Remote client Windows authentication calls could stop the server. This has 
  been fixed.
- The database schema download could fail for SQL Server. This has
  been fixed.


AceQL HTTP Version 5.0.4 - 04-Jul-2020
--------------------------------------

What's New:

- Some base libraries have been updated.
- The conf/aceql-server.properties includes now an example of the usage of
  the Tomcat JDBC Pool removeAbandoned & removeAbandonedTimeout properties.

Bugs fixed:

- nvarchar, nchar, ntext would not support NULL values. This has been fixed.


AceQL HTTP Version 5.0.3 - 15-Jun-2020
--------------------------------------

What's New:

- Windows interface signals when the user tries to reopen the app instead  
  of redisplaying it from the taskbar. 
  
- Tomcat base libraries have been updated to 8.5.56 because of security 
  requirements.

WINDOWS VERSION ONLY - AceQL HTTP  Version 5.0.2b - 25-Apr-2020
---------------------------------------------------------------

What's New:

- Support for Java 13 and 14. 
  It is highly recommended to upgrade to this AceQL version on all 
  Windows installations using Java > 8.


AceQL HTTP Version 5.0.2 - 22-Apr-2020
--------------------------------------

What's New:

- Javadoc has been enhanced for the UserAuthenticator interface and for 
  the provided implementation classes.
- Special chars (in escaped format) are now supported in LDAP Distinguished Names.

Bugs fixed:

- The schema produced by the db_schema_download API would not include correctly 
  the database tables with MS SQL Server. This has been fixed.
 

AceQL HTTP Version 5.0.1 - 10-Apr-2020
--------------------------------------

Bugs fixed:

- SELECT calls with more than 20Kb output could randomly fail because 
  of a bug in Glassfish javax.json JSON parser that inserts a \r\n at 
  each 20Kb output.
  This has been fixed by calling JsonGenerator.flush() on each
  SQL row dump.


AceQL HTTP Version 5.0 - 08-Apr-2020
------------------------------------

What's New:

- The software has been rewritten to allow quick start & standard usage 
  without any coding and without code injection: standard but complete 
  configuration may be done entirely by defining values in the 
  aceql-server.properties file. 
  Sophisticated firewalling can be done through a CSV File without any coding.
  Advanced usage is still possible through code injection using Java classes. 
  
- The new authentication architecture allows to plug-and-play existing built-in
  authentication classes without any coding or code injection, just by defining
  values in the aceql-server.properties file.
  This version provides default authentication against a LDAP server, against a 
  SSH Server, against a Windows Server and against a Web Service. 
  Your own legacy authentication usage is nonetheless supported through code 
  injection with Java classes.
  
- The aceql-server.properties file has been reorganized and simplified.

- JSON parser javax.json has been updated to 1.1.4. Tomcat base libraries
  have been updated to 8.3.53 because of Security requirements.
   

AceQL HTTP Version 4.1 - 13-Feb-2020
------------------------------------

What's New:

- The new CsvRulesManager SqlFirewallManager implementation allows to
  fine control access to SQL tables without any Java programming.
  Rules are declared in a CSV file that is loaded at server startup. 
  Rules are checked for each incoming SQL call. 
  See the User Guides & Javadoc for more info.


AceQL HTTP Version 4.0 - 15-Jan-2020
------------------------------------

What's New:

- SQL firewalling is now done through the SqlFirewallManager 
  interface. SqlFirewallManager concrete classes may be chained 
  to easily add new rulesets. This also allows to 
  properly isolate and reuse firewalling code.
  Default built-in implementations are provided for an easy 
  startup without any coding. 

- The new metadata API allows downloading a remote database schema
  in HTML or text format, to get a remote database main properties, 
  to get the list of tables, and to get the details of each table.
  It also allows wrapping remote tables, columns, indexes, etc. into
  easy to use provided Java, C# and Python classes in the client SDKs: 
  Table, Index, Column, etc.
  HTML and text schemas are rendered with SchemaCrawler (www.schemacrawler.com).
  The metadata API allows exposing more easily the databases along with the 
  schemas, without any need to communicate, maintain or synchronize separated
  documentation for the API users. Users are thus autonomous to explore 
  the metadata and schema of the exposed databases.  
  
- StatementAnalyzer has been retrofitted with an external heavily used 
  and highly supported SQL parser  (JSqlParser library - 
  https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser).
  
- Tomcat base libraries have been updated to 8.5.50 (Security requirements). 

- AceQL HTTP requires now Java 8 or higher.

AceQL HTTP Version 3.2.1 - 10-aug-2019
---------------------------------------

Bugs fixed:
- aceql-server -stop was returning -1 exit code instead of 0. It
  could cause a problem when using CI tools like Jenkins. This has been fixed.
 

AceQL HTTP Version 3.2 - 23-apr-2019
------------------------------------

What's new:
- Update Tomcat base libraries to 8.5.40 (Security requirements).

------------------------------------

What's new:
- destroy() call has been added to main servlet ServerSqlManager for
  clean shutdown of ThreadPoolExecutor without warnings.

  from concurrent clients. This has been fixed. 


AceQL HTTP Version 3.0 - 17-dec-2018
------------------------------------

- AceQL open source / Community Edition now supports all main database
  vendors.
- Main servlet is now async for better reliability and performances.
- DatabaseConfigurator.allowStatementAfterAnalysis method 
  has been renamed to allowSqlRunAfterAnalysis for the sake of
  clarity.

- Update other misc Maven dependencies.


AceQL HTTP Version 2.1 - 18-jun-2018
------------------------------------

What's new:

- This version now supports stored procedure calls from client side. 
  See you preferred AceQL client SDK for usage.

------------------------------------

What's new:

- Server allows to create new Connection without re-authentication.
- It is now possible to create and use from client side more than
  one Connection on the same database.
  
- Stateful mode is now the main and only mode. This simplifies
  the software architecture, the user documentation and ease of 
  used for developers.
  
- DatabaseConfigurator.getConnectionMaxAge() has been removed 
  because of duplicate usage. (Same kind of value can be set when 
  defining Connection pool whatever pool system is used).
  
- DefaultSessionConfigurator: getSessionTimelife() is now 0 
  (infinite session lifetime) instead of 12 hours.
  
- Connections Store cleaning has been completely rewritten. A 
  cleaning thread is regularly launched instead of a permanent
  thread.

-------------------------------------------

What's New:

- The signature of DatabaseConfigurator.login method has been changed 
  and has 2 more parameters: database and ipAddress.
  This allows implementation code to know to which database the 
  client wants to connect and to get IP address of client if
  necessary for security reasons.
  
- Thus, the previous 1.0-beta-4 DatabaseConfigurator implementations 
  are  not compatible with this 1.0-beta-5 version: the login method 
  signature must be changed.
