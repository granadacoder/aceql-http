  <comment>AceQL HTTP is a framework of REST like http APIs that allow to access to remote SQL databases over http from any device that supports http. 

AceQL HTTP is provided with three client SDK:
- The AceQL C# Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using Microsoft SQL Server like calls in their code, just like they would for a local database.
- The AceQL Java Client JDBC Driver allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using JDBC calls in their code, just like they would for a local database.
- The AceQL Python Client SDK allows SQL calls to be encoded with standard unmodified DB-API 2.0 syntax. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
